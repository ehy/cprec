This source package will build two tool programs: the namesake
'cprec' and, by configuration option, 'dd-dvd' (the option is
"--enable-dd-dvd").  These tools are helpers for making a backup
of DVD video.

Both programs depend on a library called libdvdread, but libdvdread
is not a prerequisite to build and install the programs, because
by default the programs attempt to load libdvdread and its symbols
at runtime. See INSTALL.
