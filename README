This source package will build three tool programs: the namesake
'cprec' and dd-dvd (the latter can be disbabled by configure
option --disable-dd-dvd) and wxDVDBackup.
These tools are helpers for making
a backup of DVD video.

Both programs depend on a library called libdvdread, but libdvdread
is not a prerequisite to build and install the programs, because
by default the programs attempt to load libdvdread and its symbols
at runtime. See INSTALL.
